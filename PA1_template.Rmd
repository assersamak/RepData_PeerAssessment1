## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip","activity.csv"))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
dayTotal <- aggregate(x = data$steps, by = list(data$date), FUN = sum)
```

### A histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(dayTotal$x, xlab = "Total Steps / Day", main = "Histogram of Total Steps per day")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
m <- mean(dayTotal$x, na.rm = TRUE)
med <- median(dayTotal$x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean of the total number of steps taken per day = `r m` and the median = `r med` .



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
